We encountered a problem while reading the routes from your applications source.
This might happen when there are lazy-loaded routes, that are not loaded,
Or when there are paths we can not resolve statically.
Check the routes in your app, rebuild and retry.

[32mWhen there are extraRoutes in your config, we will still try to render those.[39m



----------------------------------
Using stored unhandled routes!.
   To discover new routes in the angular app use "[33mnpm run scully -- --scanRoutes[39m"
